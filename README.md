# weatherdks

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

For this application use API client with all necessary data about weather.
[MetaWeather API](https://www.metaweather.com/)

We'll be focusing on two endpoints:

- /api/location/search/?query=$city to get a locationId for a given city name
- /api/location/$locationId to get the weather for a given locationId
